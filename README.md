# [SKYLINES](www.patriciogonzalezvivo.com/2014/skylines/)

This series of projects is about awareness - more precisely about the tools and techniques we use to see the world around us.

These projects are part of an ongoing [process](http://www.patriciogonzalezvivo.com/2014/skylines/process.php) nourished by different motivations during my last year as a Parson's MFA DT student and presented as three explorations around the theme of  Landscape.
